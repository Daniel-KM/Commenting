== USAGE ==

Commenting will automatically add commenting options to Item Show pages. To enable commenting on other
record types from modules (e.g. SimplePages or ExhibitBuilder), you will have to add the following lines
to the appropriate place in the plugin's public view script:

<?php commenting_echo_comments(); ?>
<?php commenting_echo_comment_form(); ?>

For example, to show comments on exhibit sections and pages, the file /plugins/ExhibitBuilder/views/public/exhibits/show.php
could look like:

<?php head(array('title' => html_escape(exhibit('title') . ' : '. exhibit_page('title')), 'bodyid'=>'exhibit','bodyclass'=>'show')); ?>
<div id="primary">
	<h1><?php echo link_to_exhibit(); ?></h1>

    <div id="nav-container">
    	<?php echo exhibit_builder_section_nav();?>
    	<?php echo exhibit_builder_page_nav();?>
    </div>

	<h2><?php echo exhibit_page('title'); ?></h2>
	
	<?php exhibit_builder_render_exhibit_page(); ?>
	
	<div id="exhibit-page-navigation">
	   	<?php echo exhibit_builder_link_to_previous_exhibit_page(); ?>
    	<?php echo exhibit_builder_link_to_next_exhibit_page(); ?>
	</div>
	<?php commenting_echo_comments(); ?>
	<?php commenting_echo_comment_form(); ?>
</div>
<?php foot(); ?>

Keep in mind that updating plugins or themes will clobber your addition of the commenting functions.

The Commenting plugin knows how to work with SimplePages, Collections, and ExhibitBuilder. Due to variability
in how plugins store their data in the database, other record types and views supplied by other plugins 
might or might not work out of the box. Please ask on the forums or dev list if you would like Commenting
to work with other plugins.
